# it seems to complain if there's no parameter (even though it claims it's optional);
# further if only one char is used all becomes astrix.  Hence '-a __'.
# And another thing... It complains if you Node.connect :"a@b" has some weirdnesses,
# complaining about unsafe_to_atom; if if you assign identifier to variable that works.
